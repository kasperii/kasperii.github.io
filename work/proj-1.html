During the autumn of 2018 the German Netlight office in MÃ¼nchen arranges
the fourth edge X conference. I have worked as the art director for the
event and the digital content surrounding the conference.

The conference is hosted in an old fashioned closed down office, former Tengelmann Supermarket head office building, at the top floor
 at the directors office - where the surfaces are all marbel. The building is also
  hosting an contemporary art gallery during the event with artists from all around the world.

The design turns the marble stone from the upper floor to a liquid symbolising how flat organisation of today break the old business structures.
