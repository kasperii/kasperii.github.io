    With the increasing adoption of body tracking technology, users are able to collect bio-data which designers struggle to make legible or actionable. This work presents a sleep forecasting system, where the user can navigate different schedules around scheduled activities and current motivations for sleep.

    On the backend the system relied on a reinforcement learning model that is trained to schedule sleep around a schedule with the goal of optimising the users preferences and points of high alertness. This relies on a model of 'Three Process Model of Alertness' and builds on the users existing tracked sleep data. This project also reframes how sleep data is visualised with a representation that does not segment time into days, but provides a countinious curve to fit non-normative schedules and multiple sleeps each day.
