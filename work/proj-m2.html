<p> Mute Mike II. The VR experience that lets you try out new technology while exploring a game genre from the past. You have just infiltrated the mob when something goes wrong - someone has been murdered. Your task is to explore and find out who is the killer, while at the same time trying to escape the mansion. This game was produced with the help of VIC, the Visualisation Studio at KTH. The camera [back Bone with 220Â° lens] was lent to us from raptor vision, a company dedicated to working with VR camera experiece.
