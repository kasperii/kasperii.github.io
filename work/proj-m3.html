<p> Soar and fall - a slowpace game in the sky.

    The game is built up of several biomes, cubic floating islands, where every biome have a puzzle. Each puzzle should craft, or create a path to progress onto the next biome. On the final biome the player can find itâ€™s friends and family, and the demo ends there.
