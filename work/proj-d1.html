    This research include agency over self tracking and sleep technologies. The aim is to use the craft and practice of design as a research tool to explore how sleep data can be interacted with. This work has resulted in much design work and several published articles.

    Over the course of my work I have developed several design approaches for quick thematic understanding of the user, design space, and design sketching.

    One of the reoccuring practices I have developed is mapping existing technologies in a space to understand the their different thematic stucturing and interaction.
