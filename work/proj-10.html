Planning poker cards produced for Netlight.

Planning poker (or Scrum poker) is used in agile development to estimate the relative size of different tasks.
There were 11 numbers in total and two joker cards {0, 1/2, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 20, 40, 100, ?, Coffee} for each color.
We had these printed in 200 cards packs and distributed to all our offices.
