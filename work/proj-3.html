<p>Edge Hamburg, is the annual conference in the fall. I worked as the Art Director for the event 2018.</p>

<p>This included producing a brand book for the yearly concept and the design.</p>

<p>The typeface and the colours are closely related to the brand concept of Netlight.</p>

<p>The pattern was generated and featured different variations with similar shape.</p>
