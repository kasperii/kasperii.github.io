    Alarm clock is one of the most used applications – yet many of its usage patterns are not designed for.

   This work is grounded in extensive research, through first mapping the space of alarms and their modalities - following, scoping surveys to get larger scale understadning of everday alarm clock usage – and lastly focus interviews with extensive alarm users. This work illuminated how the alarm was much more than a wake-up system, but for some users fuctioned as their main system to organise and get things done. Following the study I sketched five concepts aimed at function as points of departure for new ways to interact with the alarm system.
