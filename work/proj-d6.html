    Drawing on the qualitative analysis of three weeks of artistic activities within a residency program, this work present six types of Fractured Objects that were used in sketching a mixed-reality performance.

These fractured objects are:
    <ul>

        <li> Recreated - A physical object recreated in VR
        </li>
        <li> Mismatched - A physical object mapped to a completely different object in VR
        </li>
        <li> Phantom-VR - A phantom object in VR
        </li>
        <li> Untouchable - A phantom object in the physical world
        </li>
        <li> Visually Adapted - A modified physical object in VR
        </li>
        <li> Physically Modified - A VR object modified in the physical world
        </li>
    </ul>

    Following the definition of these objects, I sketched three scenarios of experiences that could be designed for using these fractured objects as element of the interaction. This figure above showcases an experience where the fracture between what is seen and what is felt highlights future
    drought regulation as a series on climate futures. <it> As the user is watching their water slowly stop flowing, they are grounded in the reality as it is today with their other senses able to hear, feel, and smell the water still flowing. In this envisaged scenario, the narrator then explains both why the water has ceased to flow and guides the user in understanding how the fractures in the experience of the Visually Adapted tap and the running water highlight and enhance impact of the projected loss. </it>
